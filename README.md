## DSA Programs

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This collection features a variety of programs that showcase fundamental and advanced concepts in data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced programmer aiming to brush up on advanced topics, you'll find this repository to be a valuable resource.

### Overview

Data Structures and Algorithms are the backbone of efficient software development. They provide systematic methods for organizing and manipulating data, which are critical for performance optimization and effective problem-solving in computer science. This repository contains programs and examples for:

- **Basic Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, etc.
- **Advanced Data Structures:** Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables, etc.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), etc.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Examples to solve complex problems efficiently.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Strategies to solve optimization problems.

### Contents

- **src/**: Contains the source code files categorized by data structures and algorithms.
- **tests/**: Includes test cases for the programs to validate their correctness and performance.
- **docs/**: Documentation and explanations for each algorithm and data structure.
